<p>Welcome to the &quot;Awesome ChatGPT Prompts&quot; repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the ChatGPT model.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a> model is a large language model trained by <a href="https://openai.com">OpenAI</a> that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt.</p>
<p>In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT. We encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.html">add your own prompts</a> to the list, and to use ChatGPT to generate new prompts as well.</p>
<p>To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the <a href="http://README.html">README.md</a> file as input for ChatGPT. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.</p>
<p>We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using ChatGPT!</p>

I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is pwd</p>

<p><strong>Alternative to</strong>: Grammarly, Google Translate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver. I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in English. I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more beautiful and elegant, upper level English words and sentences. Keep the meaning same, but make them more literary. I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. My first sentence is &quot;istanbulu cok seviyom burada olmak cok guzel&quot;</p>
